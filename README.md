-To prioritize performance, i used classes like Span<char>, Memory<char>, ReadOnlyMemory<char>, HashSet, and dictionaries, and I used LINQ as little as possible.
-For the SearchWord method, i used a foreach loop instead of Any or Contains since it provides better performance.
-I created a test project to validate the solution.
